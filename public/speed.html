            GANSU, Northwest China — Sometimes, after he finishes his shift at the refinery, Du Yiming
            takes a walk through the ruined oil town where he grew up. He wanders past his family’s now-abandoned
            apartment on a street littered with vacant lots, around the former hospital overgrown with junk, and on
            through the silent suburbs, where the wind whistles in from the Gobi Desert and peels pastel-colored
            paint
            off the housing blocks.<br>

            Memories loom large in Yumen, a proud town that fostered not only three generations of Du’s family, but
            also
            the soul of socialist China. Home to the country’s oldest oil well, Yumen boomed after the Communist
            takeover in 1949. Even after extraction peaked a decade later, the town remained an industrial
            powerhouse
            and a feted example of the supposed superiority of Chinese socialism, with the government lauding its
            oil
            workers and commissioning art, films, and poetry inspired by the Yumen “Iron Spirit.” Elderly residents
            boast that for a while, life here was as comfortable as it was in Shanghai.<br>


            Residents of Old Yumen explain to Sixth Tone how their city was once bustling and prosperous. By Daniel
            Holmes/Sixth Tone<br>

            Few would make that claim now. Decades of declining yields and the development of other oil fields made
            China less reliant on Yumen, whose fortunes slid further after sweeping economic reforms in the 1980s
            and
            ’90s dismantled the planned economy, restructured unprofitable state-owned energy companies, and forced
            the
            town to compete in a market where more money could be made elsewhere, prompting thousands of residents
            to
            leave.<br>

            China has wrestled with the demise of single-resource cities like Yumen for years. In 2013, the State
            Council — the country’s Cabinet — published an official list of 262 ailing “resource-based cities” as
            part
            of a plan to transform their economies, ensure sustainable development, and help them catch up with
            rapid
            nationwide growth by 2020. Many are towns in China’s Rust Belt that have fallen on hard times: exhausted
            northeastern coal pits, forest-swathed frontier towns that no longer permit logging, copper mines whose
            seams have run dry. Compared with more developed cities in the east and south, these places suffer from
            higher rates of poverty, joblessness, and population decline.<br>


            Yumen also appears on that list, even though the city has been audaciously attempting to reverse its
            fortunes for nearly two decades. Instead of trying to pump new life into the oil industry, the local
            government built a brand-new city some 80 kilometers away from the original town, integrated it into a
            burgeoning regional wind-energy sector, and relocated most of the oil town’s remaining residents. Yumen
            was
            lauded for trading a finite energy source for one that will never run out, thus securing the town’s
            economic
            future and burnishing China’s green credentials in the process.<br>

            However, the reality of Yumen’s transformation is more complex. The revitalization project has
            essentially
            created two distinct cities, separated not only by geography, but also by history, wealth, and
            values.<br>

            This was my home for years, and now it’s a shadow of its former self.<br>
            - Du Yiming, oil worker<br>
            Old Yumen, as we’ll call the oil town, feels frozen in time — and not just because its idle pumpjacks,
            hissing heat pipes, and evening public-radio broadcasts evoke a socialist China of decades past. Its
            remaining oil workers often hark back to the town’s golden age, expressing deep working-class pride in
            devoting their lives to national industry and respect for the town’s unique spirit. But they despair at
            the
            town’s dwindling operations, the waning prestige of oil jobs, and the mind-numbing drudgery of laboring
            in
            an increasingly automated sector.<br>

            Meanwhile, the 167,000 residents of New Yumen — our shorthand for the new boomtown — relish its
            cosmopolitanism, chase individual fulfillment, and refuse to feel bound to their work or homes. Many of
            them
            are college-educated, middle-class young migrants who work high-skilled jobs by day and frequent
            restaurants, karaoke bars, and craft beer pubs by night. Few of them know much about the oil town, and
            fewer
            still know anyone who lives or works there. When asked about Old Yumen, many describe it as, at best, an
            irrelevance — a throwback to a bygone era. At worst, they dismissively ask: “Isn’t that just a ghost
            town?”<br>

            Oil families like Du’s, who have struggled to come to terms with Old Yumen’s fading glory, might once
            have responded to such questions with indignance. Now they just react with resignation. Standing at the top
            of Liberation Street, the town’s main thoroughfare, Du nods his head toward his boarded-up former
            apartment. “This was my home for years, and now it’s a shadow of its former self,” he says. “There’s a sense
            of
            loss, like watching autumn turn to winter.”<br>


            Running on Fumes<br>

            In the space of a few generations, Yumen’s oil families have gone from being some of the country’s most
            privileged workers to some of its most downtrodden.<br>

            Take Du, for example. The 46-year-old’s maternal grandfather was one of those sent by the early
            Communist government to go out into the bleak landscape and help build Old Yumen. Although he eventually
            returned
            to his nearby rural home village, Du’s father settled in the oil town, making Du part of the yousandai, the
            third generation of his family to work in oil.<br>

            If Du can help it, his generation will be the last. “I’m just sick to death of it all,” he says.<br>


            That’s partly because China’s oil jobs aren’t what they used to be. When Du’s father, who is in his 70s
            and retired, worked as a prospector for the local geological survey office, his job was to scour the
            unforgiving landscape in search of untapped oil seams. The work was hard, but he had the satisfaction of
            returning
            to a strong family and a thriving, prestigious community. It was the early days of Communist rule, and amid
            a
            nationwide drive to industrialize, the state trumpeted what it called Yumen’s “Iron Spirit,” a
            supposedly unique but vaguely defined combination of doggedness, self-sacrifice, and patriotism.<br>

            Being associated with the Iron Spirit allowed families like Du’s to live, if not in comfort, then at
            least in comparative privilege compared with most other Chinese people at the time. Du has particularly fond
            memories of the Lunar New Year, when the whole town would gather to celebrate. “We’d hold lion and
            dragon dances,” he recalls, gesturing toward Liberation Street. “This road was full of people.”<br>

            But the boom years didn’t last. In 1959, when Old Yumen supplied more than half of China’s oil, the
            town’s annual oil output was 1.4 million tons; by the time Du joined the refinery in 1992, that figure was
            around 400,000 tons. It has been generally declining ever since. By contrast, the country’s largest oil
            field,
            located in Daqing in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang, produces around 40 million tons per
            year.<br>

            Although Yumen still had high hopes for its nonextractive industries — which include refining,
            transportation, and petrochemicals — Du soon noticed that local official attitudes toward the area’s
            oil-related businesses were shifting. In his first couple years at the refinery, between 100 and 200 new
            workers joined annually, he says. By 1995, however, those numbers were dwindling. Today, Yumen’s oil
            industry employs around 14,000 people, compared with 240,000 in Daqing, according to research firm Oil
            Link.<br>

            Change was coming to Yumen’s oil industry in other ways, too. In 1998, the China National Petroleum
            Corporation — the country’s oil and gas behemoth — spun off most of its domestic assets as part of a
            wave of restructuring initiatives rippling through many state-owned enterprises. The following year, an
            affiliate of a new state-owned company, PetroChina, took over Yumen’s oil extraction and refining sectors,
            tasked
            with modernizing them and making them more profitable.<br>


            Soon afterward came the completion of the new city and the relocation of most of Old Yumen’s residents.
            The initiative divided the community. On one hand, it allowed many people to move into more modern,
            comfortable, better-equipped cities like New Yumen and its neighbor, Jiuquan, some 150 kilometers away. On
            the other,
            it severed long-held ties to the oil town and sparked a home-buying frenzy at odds with its collective
            spirit.<br>

            At the time, Bei Niao — the pseudonym of a 29-year-old safety inspector at the oil base’s engineering
            consultancy who is not authorized to speak to the media — was a middle-school student. “My parents and
            other grown-ups didn’t care about my exams … Everyone was relocating, and children were pushed to one side,”
            he recalls. “There was sadness, but few people showed it. They were more anxious to get out.”<br>

            When the dust settled, Old Yumen’s population had fallen to around 19,000, a mere fraction of its
            reported, but undated, peak of 130,000. Those who remained mostly did so out of poverty, nostalgia, or
            stubbornness. In subsequent years, the state largely withdrew from the town, cordoning off abandoned housing
            blocks
            and shutting down schools and hospitals. Businesses shut down; food prices rose as sustenance increasingly
            had to be trucked in from outside. By 2008, apartments on Liberation Street were selling for just 2,000 yuan
            ($290). (They are worth around 20,000 yuan today, still far lower than homes in New Yumen.)<br>

            Du’s family moved to Jiuquan, where they live in comparatively comfortable surroundings. But in some
            ways,
            Du’s life now centers around the refinery more than ever: He commutes from Jiuquan for four days at a
            time,
            works eight- or 12-hour shifts, eats in the refinery canteen, and sleeps in a basic company dormitory.
            In
            the absence of Old Yumen’s former vibrancy, there’s little to keep him occupied outside of work, and Du
            spends much of his life killing time, thinking of his wife and 16-year-old son back in Jiuquan, or
            counting
            down the days until he can retire at 55.<br>

            There was sadness, but few people showed it. They were more anxious to get out.<br>
            - Bei Niao, safety inspector<br>
            Du, a soft-spoken man in regulation blue overalls, feels ambivalent about how his life has turned out.
            On
            the positive side, he feels the refinery pays him well: His salary, which was 160 yuan per month when he
            joined, rose to 3,100 yuan earlier this year — slightly lower than average salaries in Jiuquan. But then
            again, he finds modern refinery work grindingly boring. Compared with the 1990s, his workload today is
            much
            lighter. Much of the refining process has been automated, and Du spends most shifts monitoring the
            equipment’s pressure and temperature readings with a dozen other colleagues, occasionally going out on
            two-hour patrols. “But there are never any accidents,” he sighs.<br>

            Sometimes, Du speaks to his father about the drudgery of the refinery. The older man struggles to
            understand
            his son’s complaints. Du says there is a generation gap between oil men who worked in Yumen during the
            glory
            days of the planned economy, and their sons, many of whom feel trapped for life in unfulfilling jobs
            while
            the rest of the country develops rapidly around them.<br>

            “We’re all considered sons of the oil field. And for the sake of developing the oil field, you were
            expected to devote your youth, to sacrifice your sons and grandsons,” Du says. “Well, I’ve given them my
            youth,
            but I’ll never give them my son. I’ll not let him follow in my footsteps.”<br>

            A Tale of Two Cities<br>

            Compared with the oil town’s postindustrial poverty, New Yumen is booming. Yet its rise has largely
            excluded
            the families of those who built its predecessor.<br>

            Most new migrants to New Yumen aren’t complaining, though. In recent years, significant numbers of
            young, college-educated workers have converged on the city to take on skilled jobs in the renewables
            industry.
            Lying in a natural wind gap, New Yumen is surrounded by the Jiuquan Wind Power Base, an ambitious
            government-backed project to help wean China off polluting fossil fuels.<br>

            Over the past decade, at least five state-backed energy companies have set up shop on the wind base.
            Twenty-four-year-old Luo Kai works for one of them as a turbine maintenance engineer. He declines to
            name his employer as he is not authorized to speak to the media.<br>

            The wind industry has been a boon for people like Luo, who was born in the neighboring city of Zhangye
            to parents who ran a small supermarket. He majored in energy engineering and automation at university, and
            after graduating, moved to New Yumen in 2016. He works eight days on, six days off, monitoring his
            company’s wind turbines and sometimes driving through the Gobi Desert for several hours to fix faulty
            machines.
            For his endeavors, Luo earns between 4,000 and 6,000 yuan per month, depending on bonuses — significantly
            more
            than Yumen’s average wage — and receives free room and board in the company dormitory.<br>

            On a freezing afternoon, Luo accompanies us to a wind-whipped viewing area outside New Yumen, where the
            barren plains are carpeted with neat rows of sleek white turbines. Normally reticent, he loosens up a
            little, pointing out his company’s turbines, explaining the differences between newer and older models,
            and
            reflecting on the nature of his work. Although it’s not perfect — there are times when the job feels
            monotonous or stressful — he says he’s broadly satisfied.<br>

            Crucially, however, Luo feels far less tied to the wind farm. Whereas Du speaks of life at the refinery
            with
            the tone of a man seeing out a jail sentence, Luo retains an optimism that may just be youthful
            exuberance,
            but reflects the self-confidence of someone whose qualifications potentially guarantee him a long and
            varied
            future in China’s fast-growing wind industry. He sees his current role as just a job, not a lifelong
            calling, and aims to spend the next few years saving money, getting promoted to technician, and maybe
            finding a wife before moving somewhere else.<br>

            There’s no need for me to stay here.<br>
            - Luo Kai, maintenance engineer<br>
            Luo’s sense of transience extends to his adopted city. Despite living here for three years, he hasn’t
            made
            many friends or put down deep roots. On his days off, he usually travels back to Zhangye to sleep, hit
            the
            gym, and see old friends. “There’s no need for me to stay here,” he says. “I only have to be here for
            work.”<br>

            That feeling pervades large parts of New Yumen, whose shiny surfaces tend to gloss over the sense that
            the
            city lacks the community spirit of its grubbier, older cousin. Like many new Chinese towns, New Yumen
            feels
            built to grow, its wide plazas and airy shopping malls distinctly more sterile and less cozy than the
            oil
            town over the horizon.<br>

            The city’s sense of bloat even seeps into its industrial figures. By certain metrics, New Yumen has been
            a
            success: Renewable energy production is growing rapidly, with local wind power generation standing at
            3,430
            gigawatt hours in 2017 — a 31.5% increase on the previous year. Plans are afoot to expand the potential
            power of the Jiuquan Wind Power Base to 20 gigawatts by 2020 — nearly as much as the maximum generating
            power of the Three Gorges Dam, the world’s largest energy plant by installed capacity.<br>

            Those headline figures have contributed to local economic growth. Including both the oil town and the
            new
            city, Yumen’s GDP grew 4.6% between 2017 and 2018, a similar rate to the year prior, according to the
            local
            government. Although that figure is lower than the provincial average, residents’ disposable incomes
            rose by
            around 9% during the same period, an increase that helped Yumen officially meet its poverty alleviation
            targets in April this year, ahead of a much-touted 2020 deadline.<br>

            But those headline figures mask the fact that New Yumen’s growth has centered around China’s deeply
            inefficient wind industry. Up to 60% of the produced power of certain companies at the Jiuquan Wind
            Power
            Base gets curtailed each year, according to a 2017 news report.<br>

            It’s a nationwide problem. In the early 2010s, many Chinese wind companies, backed by generous
            government
            subsidies, rapidly deployed thousands of turbines in areas far from centers of power demand. The
            country’s
            electricity storage and transmission systems failed to keep abreast of this development, meaning that
            much
            of the turbines’ power was wasted. From 2010 to 2016, more than 150,000 gigawatt hours — around 16% of
            overall wind generation — was abandoned, according to a 2018 study by the Brookings-Tsinghua Center, a
            research institute. Although the country squanders less wind energy today, overcapacity continues to dog
            the
            sector: In March, the government halted wind projects in northwestern China, including Gansu, due to
            wastage.<br>

            But perhaps most deeply of all, New Yumen’s razzle-dazzle has sown bitterness in the oil community that
            was
            here first. No oil workers Sixth Tone speaks to say they know anyone in their line of work who
            successfully
            retrained in the renewables sector, and few of the profits it generates seem to trickle back to the
            rusting
            old town. “I see them as two completely different cities,” says Bei, the safety inspector. “It breaks my
            heart to see people left living in the old town because of financial (and other kinds of) pressure. But
            people in New Yumen live pretty good lives. It makes people jealous.”<br>

            That sense of bifurcation has all but destroyed any faith Bei once had in the benefits of renewables.
            “Wind
            energy, solar energy — they’re just an appearance,” he laments. “They don’t bring genuine economic
            development.”<br>

            Generation Gap<br>

            In recent years, Old Yumen has been trying to rev up its sputtering economy by repackaging its socialist
            history for well-heeled domestic tourists. The idea isn’t unique in China: Other areas with limited
            industrial palettes, like the northern steel hub of Baotou and the former model village of Dazhai, have
            sought to cash in on so-called Red tourism.<br>

            Old Yumen’s gamble may yet pay off. But if it does, it’ll be against the odds. China’s single-resource
            towns
            are disproportionately located in far-flung, hard-to-access locations — places whose post-reform futures
            the
            planned economy couldn’t plan for. Additionally, Red tourism spots tend to ham up the nostalgia factor
            for
            older visitors who experienced socialism the first time around. They struggle to articulate a vision of
            revitalization for younger people who cleave to a very different set of values.<br>

            One person trying to resuscitate Old Yumen’s former glories is 32-year-old Wang Xiaoying, a senior staff
            member at one of the town’s few new buildings: a museum commemorating the life of Wang Jinxi, the town’s
            most famous son and one of China’s best-known socialist heroes. Built with government funding and
            completed
            last October, officials hope that the museum will preserve the history of Old Yumen, popularize its Iron
            Spirit, and draw domestic tourists to a town firmly off the beaten track.<br>

            (The Iron Spirit) will never become obsolete. Some things, like struggling through hardship, seeking
            truth
            from facts — these apply to any place in any era.<br>
            - Wang Xiaoying, museum staff<br>
            Wang Xiaoying — who is not related to Wang Jinxi — is one of the few people raised in Old Yumen who
            chose to
            return after studying and working in wealthier, more cosmopolitan cities. The provincial capital of
            Lanzhou,
            and later Beijing, left her dissatisfied with urban China’s fast-paced lifestyles and empty materialism,
            and
            felt somewhat at odds with the values she had internalized since studying Wang Jinxi at school.<br>

            Instead, Wang Xiaoying came back to her hometown and became the museum’s official communicator of the
            Iron
            Spirit, a vague jumble of ethical axioms supposedly embodied by Wang Jinxi. They include fearing neither
            hardship nor exhaustion; making the best of what you have and making something of what you don’t; and
            struggling for the good of the nation. Despite their airiness, several oil workers Sixth Tone speaks to
            can
            rattle off the slogans with little prompting.<br>

            As the story goes, Wang was born in 1923 to an impoverished peasant family in the village of Chijinbao,
            near
            Old Yumen. As a child, he herded sheep and sometimes begged in the streets; when he reached his teens,
            he
            began working at the oil field, where in 1950 he became one of Communist China’s first oil drillers.
            Later,
            he rose to the rank of brigade captain and became a member of the party, which in 1959 bestowed on him
            the
            title of “national model worker.”<br>

            The following year, as part of the country’s plan to achieve oil self-sufficiency, Wang Jinxi’s drilling
            brigade was tasked with opening up China’s largest oil field in Daqing. It was here that Wang cemented
            his
            place in the party’s hall of fame, reportedly toiling away tirelessly for five days in temperatures as
            low
            as minus 30 degrees Celsius before finally striking oil (apparently to cries of “Long live Chairman
            Mao!”),
            and earning his nickname — tieren, or “Iron Man” — from his comrades.<br>

            Even before Wang Jinxi died of stomach cancer in 1970, the party had begun to deify him, taking the
            scant
            details of his life, mixing them with national narratives of industrial development, and adding a dash
            of
            party dogma to craft the Iron Man’s image: strong, unyielding, and ideologically pure. By the mid-’60s,
            his
            swarthy face was appearing on propaganda posters, gazing dashingly into some out-of-shot socialist
            utopia,
            exhorting people to throw themselves into building national industry. Old Yumen, the community
            synonymous
            with Wang Jinxi, was also said to embody his “Iron Spirit.”<br>

            We’re the museum’s only visitors that afternoon. Wang Xiaoying meets us in the lobby under a towering
            bronze-colored statue of Wang Jinxi, all chiseled features and straining muscles. Beside each exhibit,
            Wang
            Xiaoying pauses, adopts an expression of studied awe, and gives fervent, almost proselytizing, speeches
            about Wang Jinxi’s accomplishments. She is adamant that the Iron Spirit remains relevant, despite the
            far-reaching political and economic reforms that have profoundly changed China since the 1980s. “It will
            never become obsolete,” she says. “Some things, like struggling through hardship, seeking truth from
            facts —
            these apply to any place in any era.”<br>

            But that’s not necessarily what youngsters in New Yumen think. “We don’t think about (Wang Jinxi) very
            much,” says local entrepreneur Ge Ting. “We might think that he did his job well and we should learn
            from
            him, but at the end of the day, I wouldn’t say any of that sinks in very deeply.”<br>

            Perhaps no establishment captures New Yumen’s energy better than Ge’s. The 25-year-old co-runs the
            city’s
            only craft beer pub, a haven for hipsterish youngsters with a taste for imported ales, loud pop music,
            and
            foreign fashion brands.<br>

            After the customers thin out one evening, Ge and her co-manager, Ma Ying — a teetotal Hui Muslim from
            Lanzhou — sit down and tell the story of how the bar came to be. The pair met in 2017 after Ma joined
            the
            same beauty parlor as Ge. Despite the regular hours and steady salaries, the two women felt unfulfilled,
            spending long periods of the day idle and having little to do in the evenings. “If you wanted to drink
            stuff
            like this, you’d have to go to Jiayuguan,” Ge says, referring to a large city some two hours’ drive
            away.<br>

            Ge Ting, the owner of a craft beer pub, recommends beers to customers in New Yumen, Gansu province, Dec.

            So, in a “spur-of-the-moment” decision last year, Ge and Ma decided to open their own bar. They rented a
            space next to one of New Yumen’s high-rise business hotels and set about decorating it themselves. Their
            bar
            has hot-pink walls with giant white plastic lettering spelling out the word “Supreme” in a style
            mimicking
            the well-known American streetwear outlet. A large flag bears the face of popstar Lady Gaga. As you
            might
            expect from two people who by day still work in the beauty industry, Ge and Ma themselves are
            immaculately
            groomed, wearing deftly applied makeup, dyed hair, and artfully scruffy clothes.<br>

            The bar feels as far from Old Yumen’s tired-looking noodle joints and snooker halls as it is possible to
            be.
            And perhaps that’s not surprising: Even Ge, who was raised in New Yumen when it was still a semirural
            backwater and used to entertain herself by playing with frogs by the river, has no interest in visiting
            Old
            Yumen, let alone living there — “only if the rent here became far too high,” she laughs.<br>

            Sometimes, when she was young, Ge’s grandparents told her stories about Wang Jinxi. While she enjoyed
            them,
            she feels they resonated much more with her older relatives than with the children of China’s more
            individualistic post-reform generations. “I suppose it’s similar to liking a celebrity,” she says. “But
            I
            just don’t feel like he has much of a connection to what we do now.”<br>

            Red Star Fading<br>

            Along the ramrod-straight highway a couple miles out from Old Yumen, flanked on either side by distant,
            blue-gray mountains, stands a beaten-up plastic model of a smiling police officer, one hand raised in a
            permanent wave. Tellingly, it gazes not toward the distant horizon, but back toward the town — not
            welcoming
            newcomers, but bidding farewell to those who leave.<br>

            Recent projects aimed at bringing some life back to Old Yumen have struggled to make people stay. Staff
            at
            the museum to Wang Jinxi say they have received a few Red tourists, and officials have added an academy
            for
            party cadres next door. In addition, a number of artists, photographers, and filmmakers, drawn by the
            town’s
            dramatic landscapes and time capsule-like charm, have temporarily taken up residence there. Last year,
            as
            part of an organized street-art tour, a group of more than 10 international graffiti artists converged
            on
            Old Yumen and spray-painted a vast orange-and-black robot, complete with glaring neon-green eyes, on an
            abandoned recreation ground. They called it “Iron Man.”<br>

            It makes me very sad. I don’t think things should have come to this.<br>
            - Bei Niao, safety inspector<br>
            But ultimately, the tourists’ vacations end, the cadres get deployed elsewhere, and the artists return
            home.
            Even the pockets of chatting oil workers clustering along Refinery Street and in the small market don’t
            settle here permanently anymore. Bei, the safety inspector, often feels compelled to grab his camera and
            document the town’s demise. “Nowadays, when I photograph Old Yumen, I constantly go back to the question
            of
            why it had to decline,” he says. “It makes me very sad. I don’t think things should have come to this.
            It
            was certainly man-made.”<br>

            Perhaps emboldened by the town’s low expectations, those who do choose to live in Old Yumen tend toward
            somewhat eccentric pursuits. Away from the oil businesses, we met many other vibrant characters: the
            shifty-eyed wheeler-dealer hawking secondhand electronics in the hospital-cum-junkyard; the gold-toothed
            Hui
            merchant who sold goji berries from the back room of a disused mosque; the kiosk owner who bought a home
            in
            Old Yumen right before property prices collapsed, lost much of his savings, and more than a decade later
            spends his evenings writing calligraphy and screeching away on the zither in a fashion that, even to the
            untrained ear, sounded terrible.<br>

            Many of these people declined to be formally interviewed. Some said they were ill-informed about the
            town,
            others professed shyness, and one or two simply refused to say anything more. Several other interviews
            were
            interrupted after drawing the attention of local authorities. To protect them from potential
            repercussions,
            we did not quote those interviewees in this piece.<br>

            Neither the Yumen municipal government nor the Gansu provincial government responded to Sixth Tone’s
            multiple requests for comment on the health of the region’s oil community and energy industries. We
            received
            similar treatment from PetroChina and four of the five wind companies operating in Yumen. One initially
            willing wind firm later declined our interview request after conferring with its provincial
            headquarters.<br>

            Officials say 100 years’ worth of oil once lay in Old Yumen’s fields. If that’s accurate, then the town
            has
            about 20 years left. What will happen to it after that is unclear.<br>

            Wang Xiaoying, the head of the museum, is defiant. “Will we be the last generation of oil people in
            Yumen?
            No, after we’ve stopped extracting the oil, we’ll just refine it,” she asserts. “(Chinese workers) are
            striking oil in Sudan, in Chad … and (oil companies) are bringing it back batch by batch.”<br>

            But Du, the refinery worker, is not so confident. “We do worry that this will all disappear. Sometimes,
            in
            our downtime, we talk about it — whether our generation will be safe, whether this enterprise will be
            able
            to sustain us. But small-time workers like us don’t decide what happens — that’s for our leaders to
            decide.”<br>

            He shifts his weight onto his other foot and looks down at the pump jacks resting, heads bowed, in the
            valley below. “All we can do is to finish the job as professionally as we possibly can. A good day’s
            work
            becomes a good year’s work, and then a good life’s work. That’s the Iron Spirit, too.”<br>

            GANSU, Northwest China — Sometimes, after he finishes his shift at the refinery, Du Yiming
            takes a walk through the ruined oil town where he grew up. He wanders past his family’s now-abandoned
            apartment on a street littered with vacant lots, around the former hospital overgrown with junk, and on
            through the silent suburbs, where the wind whistles in from the Gobi Desert and peels pastel-colored
            paint
            off the housing blocks.<br>

            Memories loom large in Yumen, a proud town that fostered not only three generations of Du’s family, but
            also
            the soul of socialist China. Home to the country’s oldest oil well, Yumen boomed after the Communist
            takeover in 1949. Even after extraction peaked a decade later, the town remained an industrial
            powerhouse
            and a feted example of the supposed superiority of Chinese socialism, with the government lauding its
            oil
            workers and commissioning art, films, and poetry inspired by the Yumen “Iron Spirit.” Elderly residents
            boast that for a while, life here was as comfortable as it was in Shanghai.<br>


            Residents of Old Yumen explain to Sixth Tone how their city was once bustling and prosperous. By Daniel
            Holmes/Sixth Tone<br>

            Few would make that claim now. Decades of declining yields and the development of other oil fields made
            China less reliant on Yumen, whose fortunes slid further after sweeping economic reforms in the 1980s
            and
            ’90s dismantled the planned economy, restructured unprofitable state-owned energy companies, and forced
            the
            town to compete in a market where more money could be made elsewhere, prompting thousands of residents
            to
            leave.<br>

            China has wrestled with the demise of single-resource cities like Yumen for years. In 2013, the State
            Council — the country’s Cabinet — published an official list of 262 ailing “resource-based cities” as
            part
            of a plan to transform their economies, ensure sustainable development, and help them catch up with
            rapid
            nationwide growth by 2020. Many are towns in China’s Rust Belt that have fallen on hard times: exhausted
            northeastern coal pits, forest-swathed frontier towns that no longer permit logging, copper mines whose
            seams have run dry. Compared with more developed cities in the east and south, these places suffer from
            higher rates of poverty, joblessness, and population decline.<br>


            Yumen also appears on that list, even though the city has been audaciously attempting to reverse its
            fortunes for nearly two decades. Instead of trying to pump new life into the oil industry, the local
            government built a brand-new city some 80 kilometers away from the original town, integrated it into a
            burgeoning regional wind-energy sector, and relocated most of the oil town’s remaining residents. Yumen
            was
            lauded for trading a finite energy source for one that will never run out, thus securing the town’s
            economic
            future and burnishing China’s green credentials in the process.<br>

            However, the reality of Yumen’s transformation is more complex. The revitalization project has
            essentially
            created two distinct cities, separated not only by geography, but also by history, wealth, and
            values.<br>

            This was my home for years, and now it’s a shadow of its former self.<br>
            - Du Yiming, oil worker<br>
            Old Yumen, as we’ll call the oil town, feels frozen in time — and not just because its idle pumpjacks,
            hissing heat pipes, and evening public-radio broadcasts evoke a socialist China of decades past. Its
            remaining oil workers often hark back to the town’s golden age, expressing deep working-class pride in
            devoting their lives to national industry and respect for the town’s unique spirit. But they despair at
            the
            town’s dwindling operations, the waning prestige of oil jobs, and the mind-numbing drudgery of laboring
            in
            an increasingly automated sector.<br>

            Meanwhile, the 167,000 residents of New Yumen — our shorthand for the new boomtown — relish its
            cosmopolitanism, chase individual fulfillment, and refuse to feel bound to their work or homes. Many of
            them
            are college-educated, middle-class young migrants who work high-skilled jobs by day and frequent
            restaurants, karaoke bars, and craft beer pubs by night. Few of them know much about the oil town, and
            fewer
            still know anyone who lives or works there. When asked about Old Yumen, many describe it as, at best, an
            irrelevance — a throwback to a bygone era. At worst, they dismissively ask: “Isn’t that just a ghost
            town?”<br>

            Oil families like Du’s, who have struggled to come to terms with Old Yumen’s fading glory, might once
            have responded to such questions with indignance. Now they just react with resignation. Standing at the top
            of Liberation Street, the town’s main thoroughfare, Du nods his head toward his boarded-up former
            apartment. “This was my home for years, and now it’s a shadow of its former self,” he says. “There’s a sense
            of
            loss, like watching autumn turn to winter.”<br>


            Running on Fumes<br>

            In the space of a few generations, Yumen’s oil families have gone from being some of the country’s most
            privileged workers to some of its most downtrodden.<br>

            Take Du, for example. The 46-year-old’s maternal grandfather was one of those sent by the early
            Communist government to go out into the bleak landscape and help build Old Yumen. Although he eventually
            returned
            to his nearby rural home village, Du’s father settled in the oil town, making Du part of the yousandai, the
            third generation of his family to work in oil.<br>

            If Du can help it, his generation will be the last. “I’m just sick to death of it all,” he says.<br>


            That’s partly because China’s oil jobs aren’t what they used to be. When Du’s father, who is in his 70s
            and retired, worked as a prospector for the local geological survey office, his job was to scour the
            unforgiving landscape in search of untapped oil seams. The work was hard, but he had the satisfaction of
            returning
            to a strong family and a thriving, prestigious community. It was the early days of Communist rule, and amid
            a
            nationwide drive to industrialize, the state trumpeted what it called Yumen’s “Iron Spirit,” a
            supposedly unique but vaguely defined combination of doggedness, self-sacrifice, and patriotism.<br>

            Being associated with the Iron Spirit allowed families like Du’s to live, if not in comfort, then at
            least in comparative privilege compared with most other Chinese people at the time. Du has particularly fond
            memories of the Lunar New Year, when the whole town would gather to celebrate. “We’d hold lion and
            dragon dances,” he recalls, gesturing toward Liberation Street. “This road was full of people.”<br>

            But the boom years didn’t last. In 1959, when Old Yumen supplied more than half of China’s oil, the
            town’s annual oil output was 1.4 million tons; by the time Du joined the refinery in 1992, that figure was
            around 400,000 tons. It has been generally declining ever since. By contrast, the country’s largest oil
            field,
            located in Daqing in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang, produces around 40 million tons per
            year.<br>

            Although Yumen still had high hopes for its nonextractive industries — which include refining,
            transportation, and petrochemicals — Du soon noticed that local official attitudes toward the area’s
            oil-related businesses were shifting. In his first couple years at the refinery, between 100 and 200 new
            workers joined annually, he says. By 1995, however, those numbers were dwindling. Today, Yumen’s oil
            industry employs around 14,000 people, compared with 240,000 in Daqing, according to research firm Oil
            Link.<br>

            Change was coming to Yumen’s oil industry in other ways, too. In 1998, the China National Petroleum
            Corporation — the country’s oil and gas behemoth — spun off most of its domestic assets as part of a
            wave of restructuring initiatives rippling through many state-owned enterprises. The following year, an
            affiliate of a new state-owned company, PetroChina, took over Yumen’s oil extraction and refining sectors,
            tasked
            with modernizing them and making them more profitable.<br>


            Soon afterward came the completion of the new city and the relocation of most of Old Yumen’s residents.
            The initiative divided the community. On one hand, it allowed many people to move into more modern,
            comfortable, better-equipped cities like New Yumen and its neighbor, Jiuquan, some 150 kilometers away. On
            the other,
            it severed long-held ties to the oil town and sparked a home-buying frenzy at odds with its collective
            spirit.<br>

            At the time, Bei Niao — the pseudonym of a 29-year-old safety inspector at the oil base’s engineering
            consultancy who is not authorized to speak to the media — was a middle-school student. “My parents and
            other grown-ups didn’t care about my exams … Everyone was relocating, and children were pushed to one side,”
            he recalls. “There was sadness, but few people showed it. They were more anxious to get out.”<br>

            When the dust settled, Old Yumen’s population had fallen to around 19,000, a mere fraction of its
            reported, but undated, peak of 130,000. Those who remained mostly did so out of poverty, nostalgia, or
            stubbornness. In subsequent years, the state largely withdrew from the town, cordoning off abandoned housing
            blocks
            and shutting down schools and hospitals. Businesses shut down; food prices rose as sustenance increasingly
            had to be trucked in from outside. By 2008, apartments on Liberation Street were selling for just 2,000 yuan
            ($290). (They are worth around 20,000 yuan today, still far lower than homes in New Yumen.)<br>

            Du’s family moved to Jiuquan, where they live in comparatively comfortable surroundings. But in some
            ways,
            Du’s life now centers around the refinery more than ever: He commutes from Jiuquan for four days at a
            time,
            works eight- or 12-hour shifts, eats in the refinery canteen, and sleeps in a basic company dormitory.
            In
            the absence of Old Yumen’s former vibrancy, there’s little to keep him occupied outside of work, and Du
            spends much of his life killing time, thinking of his wife and 16-year-old son back in Jiuquan, or
            counting
            down the days until he can retire at 55.<br>

            There was sadness, but few people showed it. They were more anxious to get out.<br>
            - Bei Niao, safety inspector<br>
            Du, a soft-spoken man in regulation blue overalls, feels ambivalent about how his life has turned out.
            On
            the positive side, he feels the refinery pays him well: His salary, which was 160 yuan per month when he
            joined, rose to 3,100 yuan earlier this year — slightly lower than average salaries in Jiuquan. But then
            again, he finds modern refinery work grindingly boring. Compared with the 1990s, his workload today is
            much
            lighter. Much of the refining process has been automated, and Du spends most shifts monitoring the
            equipment’s pressure and temperature readings with a dozen other colleagues, occasionally going out on
            two-hour patrols. “But there are never any accidents,” he sighs.<br>

            Sometimes, Du speaks to his father about the drudgery of the refinery. The older man struggles to
            understand
            his son’s complaints. Du says there is a generation gap between oil men who worked in Yumen during the
            glory
            days of the planned economy, and their sons, many of whom feel trapped for life in unfulfilling jobs
            while
            the rest of the country develops rapidly around them.<br>

            “We’re all considered sons of the oil field. And for the sake of developing the oil field, you were
            expected to devote your youth, to sacrifice your sons and grandsons,” Du says. “Well, I’ve given them my
            youth,
            but I’ll never give them my son. I’ll not let him follow in my footsteps.”<br>

            A Tale of Two Cities<br>

            Compared with the oil town’s postindustrial poverty, New Yumen is booming. Yet its rise has largely
            excluded
            the families of those who built its predecessor.<br>

            Most new migrants to New Yumen aren’t complaining, though. In recent years, significant numbers of
            young, college-educated workers have converged on the city to take on skilled jobs in the renewables
            industry.
            Lying in a natural wind gap, New Yumen is surrounded by the Jiuquan Wind Power Base, an ambitious
            government-backed project to help wean China off polluting fossil fuels.<br>

            Over the past decade, at least five state-backed energy companies have set up shop on the wind base.
            Twenty-four-year-old Luo Kai works for one of them as a turbine maintenance engineer. He declines to
            name his employer as he is not authorized to speak to the media.<br>

            The wind industry has been a boon for people like Luo, who was born in the neighboring city of Zhangye
            to parents who ran a small supermarket. He majored in energy engineering and automation at university, and
            after graduating, moved to New Yumen in 2016. He works eight days on, six days off, monitoring his
            company’s wind turbines and sometimes driving through the Gobi Desert for several hours to fix faulty
            machines.
            For his endeavors, Luo earns between 4,000 and 6,000 yuan per month, depending on bonuses — significantly
            more
            than Yumen’s average wage — and receives free room and board in the company dormitory.<br>

            On a freezing afternoon, Luo accompanies us to a wind-whipped viewing area outside New Yumen, where the
            barren plains are carpeted with neat rows of sleek white turbines. Normally reticent, he loosens up a
            little, pointing out his company’s turbines, explaining the differences between newer and older models,
            and
            reflecting on the nature of his work. Although it’s not perfect — there are times when the job feels
            monotonous or stressful — he says he’s broadly satisfied.<br>

            Crucially, however, Luo feels far less tied to the wind farm. Whereas Du speaks of life at the refinery
            with
            the tone of a man seeing out a jail sentence, Luo retains an optimism that may just be youthful
            exuberance,
            but reflects the self-confidence of someone whose qualifications potentially guarantee him a long and
            varied
            future in China’s fast-growing wind industry. He sees his current role as just a job, not a lifelong
            calling, and aims to spend the next few years saving money, getting promoted to technician, and maybe
            finding a wife before moving somewhere else.<br>

            There’s no need for me to stay here.<br>
            - Luo Kai, maintenance engineer<br>
            Luo’s sense of transience extends to his adopted city. Despite living here for three years, he hasn’t
            made
            many friends or put down deep roots. On his days off, he usually travels back to Zhangye to sleep, hit
            the
            gym, and see old friends. “There’s no need for me to stay here,” he says. “I only have to be here for
            work.”<br>

            That feeling pervades large parts of New Yumen, whose shiny surfaces tend to gloss over the sense that
            the
            city lacks the community spirit of its grubbier, older cousin. Like many new Chinese towns, New Yumen
            feels
            built to grow, its wide plazas and airy shopping malls distinctly more sterile and less cozy than the
            oil
            town over the horizon.<br>

            The city’s sense of bloat even seeps into its industrial figures. By certain metrics, New Yumen has been
            a
            success: Renewable energy production is growing rapidly, with local wind power generation standing at
            3,430
            gigawatt hours in 2017 — a 31.5% increase on the previous year. Plans are afoot to expand the potential
            power of the Jiuquan Wind Power Base to 20 gigawatts by 2020 — nearly as much as the maximum generating
            power of the Three Gorges Dam, the world’s largest energy plant by installed capacity.<br>

            Those headline figures have contributed to local economic growth. Including both the oil town and the
            new
            city, Yumen’s GDP grew 4.6% between 2017 and 2018, a similar rate to the year prior, according to the
            local
            government. Although that figure is lower than the provincial average, residents’ disposable incomes
            rose by
            around 9% during the same period, an increase that helped Yumen officially meet its poverty alleviation
            targets in April this year, ahead of a much-touted 2020 deadline.<br>

            Tone<br>

            But those headline figures mask the fact that New Yumen’s growth has centered around China’s deeply
            inefficient wind industry. Up to 60% of the produced power of certain companies at the Jiuquan Wind
            Power
            Base gets curtailed each year, according to a 2017 news report.<br>

            It’s a nationwide problem. In the early 2010s, many Chinese wind companies, backed by generous
            government
            subsidies, rapidly deployed thousands of turbines in areas far from centers of power demand. The
            country’s
            electricity storage and transmission systems failed to keep abreast of this development, meaning that
            much
            of the turbines’ power was wasted. From 2010 to 2016, more than 150,000 gigawatt hours — around 16% of
            overall wind generation — was abandoned, according to a 2018 study by the Brookings-Tsinghua Center, a
            research institute. Although the country squanders less wind energy today, overcapacity continues to dog
            the
            sector: In March, the government halted wind projects in northwestern China, including Gansu, due to
            wastage.<br>

            But perhaps most deeply of all, New Yumen’s razzle-dazzle has sown bitterness in the oil community that
            was
            here first. No oil workers Sixth Tone speaks to say they know anyone in their line of work who
            successfully
            retrained in the renewables sector, and few of the profits it generates seem to trickle back to the
            rusting
            old town. “I see them as two completely different cities,” says Bei, the safety inspector. “It breaks my
            heart to see people left living in the old town because of financial (and other kinds of) pressure. But
            people in New Yumen live pretty good lives. It makes people jealous.”<br>

            That sense of bifurcation has all but destroyed any faith Bei once had in the benefits of renewables.
            “Wind
            energy, solar energy — they’re just an appearance,” he laments. “They don’t bring genuine economic
            development.”<br>

            Generation Gap<br>

            In recent years, Old Yumen has been trying to rev up its sputtering economy by repackaging its socialist
            history for well-heeled domestic tourists. The idea isn’t unique in China: Other areas with limited
            industrial palettes, like the northern steel hub of Baotou and the former model village of Dazhai, have
            sought to cash in on so-called Red tourism.<br>

            Old Yumen’s gamble may yet pay off. But if it does, it’ll be against the odds. China’s single-resource
            towns
            are disproportionately located in far-flung, hard-to-access locations — places whose post-reform futures
            the
            planned economy couldn’t plan for. Additionally, Red tourism spots tend to ham up the nostalgia factor
            for
            older visitors who experienced socialism the first time around. They struggle to articulate a vision of
            revitalization for younger people who cleave to a very different set of values.<br>

            One person trying to resuscitate Old Yumen’s former glories is 32-year-old Wang Xiaoying, a senior staff
            member at one of the town’s few new buildings: a museum commemorating the life of Wang Jinxi, the town’s
            most famous son and one of China’s best-known socialist heroes. Built with government funding and
            completed
            last October, officials hope that the museum will preserve the history of Old Yumen, popularize its Iron
            Spirit, and draw domestic tourists to a town firmly off the beaten track.<br>

            (The Iron Spirit) will never become obsolete. Some things, like struggling through hardship, seeking
            truth
            from facts — these apply to any place in any era.<br>
            - Wang Xiaoying, museum staff<br>
            Wang Xiaoying — who is not related to Wang Jinxi — is one of the few people raised in Old Yumen who
            chose to
            return after studying and working in wealthier, more cosmopolitan cities. The provincial capital of
            Lanzhou,
            and later Beijing, left her dissatisfied with urban China’s fast-paced lifestyles and empty materialism,
            and
            felt somewhat at odds with the values she had internalized since studying Wang Jinxi at school.<br>

            Instead, Wang Xiaoying came back to her hometown and became the museum’s official communicator of the
            Iron
            Spirit, a vague jumble of ethical axioms supposedly embodied by Wang Jinxi. They include fearing neither
            hardship nor exhaustion; making the best of what you have and making something of what you don’t; and
            struggling for the good of the nation. Despite their airiness, several oil workers Sixth Tone speaks to
            can
            rattle off the slogans with little prompting.<br>

            As the story goes, Wang was born in 1923 to an impoverished peasant family in the village of Chijinbao,
            near
            Old Yumen. As a child, he herded sheep and sometimes begged in the streets; when he reached his teens,
            he
            began working at the oil field, where in 1950 he became one of Communist China’s first oil drillers.
            Later,
            he rose to the rank of brigade captain and became a member of the party, which in 1959 bestowed on him
            the
            title of “national model worker.”<br>

            Huiyuan/Sixth Tone<br>

            The following year, as part of the country’s plan to achieve oil self-sufficiency, Wang Jinxi’s drilling
            brigade was tasked with opening up China’s largest oil field in Daqing. It was here that Wang cemented
            his
            place in the party’s hall of fame, reportedly toiling away tirelessly for five days in temperatures as
            low
            as minus 30 degrees Celsius before finally striking oil (apparently to cries of “Long live Chairman
            Mao!”),
            and earning his nickname — tieren, or “Iron Man” — from his comrades.<br>

            Even before Wang Jinxi died of stomach cancer in 1970, the party had begun to deify him, taking the
            scant
            details of his life, mixing them with national narratives of industrial development, and adding a dash
            of
            party dogma to craft the Iron Man’s image: strong, unyielding, and ideologically pure. By the mid-’60s,
            his
            swarthy face was appearing on propaganda posters, gazing dashingly into some out-of-shot socialist
            utopia,
            exhorting people to throw themselves into building national industry. Old Yumen, the community
            synonymous
            with Wang Jinxi, was also said to embody his “Iron Spirit.”<br>

            We’re the museum’s only visitors that afternoon. Wang Xiaoying meets us in the lobby under a towering
            bronze-colored statue of Wang Jinxi, all chiseled features and straining muscles. Beside each exhibit,
            Wang
            Xiaoying pauses, adopts an expression of studied awe, and gives fervent, almost proselytizing, speeches
            about Wang Jinxi’s accomplishments. She is adamant that the Iron Spirit remains relevant, despite the
            far-reaching political and economic reforms that have profoundly changed China since the 1980s. “It will
            never become obsolete,” she says. “Some things, like struggling through hardship, seeking truth from
            facts —
            these apply to any place in any era.”<br>

            But that’s not necessarily what youngsters in New Yumen think. “We don’t think about (Wang Jinxi) very
            much,” says local entrepreneur Ge Ting. “We might think that he did his job well and we should learn
            from
            him, but at the end of the day, I wouldn’t say any of that sinks in very deeply.”<br>

            Perhaps no establishment captures New Yumen’s energy better than Ge’s. The 25-year-old co-runs the
            city’s
            only craft beer pub, a haven for hipsterish youngsters with a taste for imported ales, loud pop music,
            and
            foreign fashion brands.<br>

            After the customers thin out one evening, Ge and her co-manager, Ma Ying — a teetotal Hui Muslim from
            Lanzhou — sit down and tell the story of how the bar came to be. The pair met in 2017 after Ma joined
            the
            same beauty parlor as Ge. Despite the regular hours and steady salaries, the two women felt unfulfilled,
            spending long periods of the day idle and having little to do in the evenings. “If you wanted to drink
            stuff
            like this, you’d have to go to Jiayuguan,” Ge says, referring to a large city some two hours’ drive
            away.<br>

            So, in a “spur-of-the-moment” decision last year, Ge and Ma decided to open their own bar. They rented a
            space next to one of New Yumen’s high-rise business hotels and set about decorating it themselves. Their
            bar
            has hot-pink walls with giant white plastic lettering spelling out the word “Supreme” in a style
            mimicking
            the well-known American streetwear outlet. A large flag bears the face of popstar Lady Gaga. As you
            might
            expect from two people who by day still work in the beauty industry, Ge and Ma themselves are
            immaculately
            groomed, wearing deftly applied makeup, dyed hair, and artfully scruffy clothes.<br>

            The bar feels as far from Old Yumen’s tired-looking noodle joints and snooker halls as it is possible to
            be.
            And perhaps that’s not surprising: Even Ge, who was raised in New Yumen when it was still a semirural
            backwater and used to entertain herself by playing with frogs by the river, has no interest in visiting
            Old
            Yumen, let alone living there — “only if the rent here became far too high,” she laughs.<br>

            Sometimes, when she was young, Ge’s grandparents told her stories about Wang Jinxi. While she enjoyed
            them,
            she feels they resonated much more with her older relatives than with the children of China’s more
            individualistic post-reform generations. “I suppose it’s similar to liking a celebrity,” she says. “But
            I
            just don’t feel like he has much of a connection to what we do now.”<br>

            Red Star Fading<br>

            Along the ramrod-straight highway a couple miles out from Old Yumen, flanked on either side by distant,
            blue-gray mountains, stands a beaten-up plastic model of a smiling police officer, one hand raised in a
            permanent wave. Tellingly, it gazes not toward the distant horizon, but back toward the town — not
            welcoming
            newcomers, but bidding farewell to those who leave.<br>

            Recent projects aimed at bringing some life back to Old Yumen have struggled to make people stay. Staff
            at
            the museum to Wang Jinxi say they have received a few Red tourists, and officials have added an academy
            for
            party cadres next door. In addition, a number of artists, photographers, and filmmakers, drawn by the
            town’s
            dramatic landscapes and time capsule-like charm, have temporarily taken up residence there. Last year,
            as
            part of an organized street-art tour, a group of more than 10 international graffiti artists converged
            on
            Old Yumen and spray-painted a vast orange-and-black robot, complete with glaring neon-green eyes, on an
            abandoned recreation ground. They called it “Iron Man.”<br>

            It makes me very sad. I don’t think things should have come to this.<br>
            - Bei Niao, safety inspector<br>
            But ultimately, the tourists’ vacations end, the cadres get deployed elsewhere, and the artists return
            home.
            Even the pockets of chatting oil workers clustering along Refinery Street and in the small market don’t
            settle here permanently anymore. Bei, the safety inspector, often feels compelled to grab his camera and
            document the town’s demise. “Nowadays, when I photograph Old Yumen, I constantly go back to the question
            of
            why it had to decline,” he says. “It makes me very sad. I don’t think things should have come to this.
            It
            was certainly man-made.”<br>

            Perhaps emboldened by the town’s low expectations, those who do choose to live in Old Yumen tend toward
            somewhat eccentric pursuits. Away from the oil businesses, we met many other vibrant characters: the
            shifty-eyed wheeler-dealer hawking secondhand electronics in the hospital-cum-junkyard; the gold-toothed
            Hui
            merchant who sold goji berries from the back room of a disused mosque; the kiosk owner who bought a home
            in
            Old Yumen right before property prices collapsed, lost much of his savings, and more than a decade later
            spends his evenings writing calligraphy and screeching away on the zither in a fashion that, even to the
            untrained ear, sounded terrible.<br>

            Many of these people declined to be formally interviewed. Some said they were ill-informed about the
            town,
            others professed shyness, and one or two simply refused to say anything more. Several other interviews
            were
            interrupted after drawing the attention of local authorities. To protect them from potential
            repercussions,
            we did not quote those interviewees in this piece.<br>

            Neither the Yumen municipal government nor the Gansu provincial government responded to Sixth Tone’s
            multiple requests for comment on the health of the region’s oil community and energy industries. We
            received
            similar treatment from PetroChina and four of the five wind companies operating in Yumen. One initially
            willing wind firm later declined our interview request after conferring with its provincial
            headquarters.<br>

            Officials say 100 years’ worth of oil once lay in Old Yumen’s fields. If that’s accurate, then the town
            has
            about 20 years left. What will happen to it after that is unclear.<br>

            Wang Xiaoying, the head of the museum, is defiant. “Will we be the last generation of oil people in
            Yumen?
            No, after we’ve stopped extracting the oil, we’ll just refine it,” she asserts. “(Chinese workers) are
            striking oil in Sudan, in Chad … and (oil companies) are bringing it back batch by batch.”<br>

            But Du, the refinery worker, is not so confident. “We do worry that this will all disappear. Sometimes,
            in
            our downtime, we talk about it — whether our generation will be safe, whether this enterprise will be
            able
            to sustain us. But small-time workers like us don’t decide what happens — that’s for our leaders to
            decide.”<br>

            He shifts his weight onto his other foot and looks down at the pump jacks resting, heads bowed, in the
            valley below. “All we can do is to finish the job as professionally as we possibly can. A good day’s
            work
            becomes a good year’s work, and then a good life’s work. That’s the Iron Spirit, too.”<br>
